# Pager
External Pager 
Implemented a C++ external pager, which is a process that handles virtual memory requests for application processes. The pager is analogous to the virtual-memory portion of a normal OS. The pager handles space creation, read and write faults, address space destruction, and simple argument passing between spaces. pager.cc is the program I created but I will also include the libraries for explanation purposes
